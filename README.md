=============
church-portal is open-source, web-based social networking and online directory software for churches. church-portal is built on Ruby on Rails 3 and Postgres.

Screenshots and feature information can be found at the [commercial website](http://bechurch-portal.com).


## Install on Ubuntu

church-portal is a complex app with a lot of moving parts. Installation can be lengthy, so we've tried to automate as much of the process as possible using [Capistrano](http://github.com/capistrano/capistrano).

If you're dedicated server or VPS is Ubuntu 10.04 or higher, try this:

    # 1. on your server:
    sudo adduser deploy
    sudo adduser deploy sudo
    # copy your SSH public key to avoid password prompts
    sudo apt-get install git-core curl build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline5-dev imagemagick rsync
    # follow http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/ to install RVM
    rvm install ree
    rvm use ree@church-portal --create --default

    # 2. on your local machine:
    gem install capistrano
    # edit config/deploy.rb to point to your server
    cap prepare:ubuntu:mysql
    cap prepare:ubuntu:apache
    cap prepare:ubuntu:passenger
    cap prepare:ubuntu:postfix
    cap prepare:ubuntu:bundler
    cap deploy:setup
    cap deploy:migrations

    # 3. on your server
    # edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
    # and point DocumentRoot to "/var/www/apps/church-portal/current/public"
    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
    # you may also need to set smtpd_use_tls=no in your /etc/postfix/main.cf

    # 4. in your web browser:
    # visit http://your-server-name-or-ip

We also have full step-by-step instructions in our INSTALL.md file.
